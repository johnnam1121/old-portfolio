This is a portfolio website I created using react and bootstrap. 
Thank you for taking a look!

The goal of this website is for me to practice React + Bootstrap and give my students
an example portfolio website for their upcoming projects.
The formatting of the website was inspired by Brittany Chaing's awesome website: brittanychiang.com
